# Black Friday Landing Page

https://btrndd-black-friday.netlify.app/

Hey there!

On this project, I was able to:

- Create a subscription form;
- Manipulating DOM;
- Manipulating HTML;
- Manipulating JavaScript;
- Manipulating CSS;
- Work with Flexbox;

This landing page was develop focusing on get customer's email to the Black Friday week. I could use most of everything I've already learned of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
